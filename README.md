#Practice

For this practice we should pass this steps:
  
- Make account
	- Here is the **[link](https://github.com/)** of github
- Make repository by command " git init "
- Make file .gitignore by " touch.exe .gitignore" command
- Do changes and commit them
 
Then after all this make new branch by __" git branch branch name"__ command .
 
In each step we make the changes and then commit then.

## P.S:
 1- we can distinguish the difference between two branches by the command _"git diff branch1 branch2"_.

 2- we can see the changes we've made by the last commit through this command. _"git diff"_.
